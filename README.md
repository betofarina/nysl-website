# nysl-website
website designed for a elementary soccer league.
In this project, I am an independent contractor who develops custom websites for small organizations. The Northside Youth Soccer League (NYSL) has hired me to develop a website for their soccer teams. I worked on this website on my own to learn to use modern HTML and CSS to produce an attractive, informative website based on the client's requirements.
