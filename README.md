# nysl-website
Website designed for a elementary soccer league.
In this project, I am an independent contractor who develops custom websites for small organizations. The Northside Youth Soccer League (NYSL) has hired me to develop a website for their soccer teams. I worked on this website on my own to learn to use modern HTML and CSS to produce an attractive, informative website based on the client's requirements.

Note: The reason why are 3 CSS files is that I wanted to put hands on JavaScript already and just for curiosity I wanted the style of the website to change depending on the input value of the "gender" input. Try it yourself!
